RNA-seq data is processed according to the method from previous report (Zoabi and Shomron, 2021). RNA and protein expression atlas was analyzed and demonstrated by R studio.
### Tertiary structure prediction by AlphaFold2 and amino acid mutation analysis
Protein tertiary structure was predicted using AlphaFold2 (Bkunyun Platform, https://www.bkunyun.com/index.html?source=360E8&other=). Those structures with the highest score were picked for the next analysis, and the relevant PDB files were compared by UCSF Chimera. The identified DNA mutation sites were verified by sanger sequencing and corresponding amino acid mutants were labelled within the structure. The re-constructed structure was also predicted by AlphaFold2 and the relevant amino acid side chain changes were exhibited by UCSF Chimera. Disorder regions and conversation were both predicted by IUPred3.

After incubation, the bacterial precipitate was re-suspended and mutated by ARTP (30 s, 120 W) treatment for 4 times, and then diluted to 10 mL. The titer of M13 phage was determined by DNA-LAMP method using LAMP Kit (Yeasen Biotechnology). Reaction mix was incubated at 63 °C for 10-20 min. The mutant strain was cultured at the temperature of 37 °C and at the rotate speed of 100 rpm. Phage titer was detected using DNA LAMP every 2 h, until that phage titer was up to 106 CFU/mL. If the phage titer was still lower than 106 CFU/mL, S1030-pJC175e was employed in amplifying the M13 phage. Finally, progeny M13 phage was obtained by collect the supernatant. The progeny of initial M13 phage was used as primary phage in the next round of ARTP-PANCE.
